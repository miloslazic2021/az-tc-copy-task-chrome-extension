# Introduction
This project is an extension for the Google Chrome which allows a user to "copy" task and its parent (requirement) from the Azure DevOps taskboard so it can be "pasted" to the Timecockpit entry.

## Installation
- Import ("Load unpacked") the extension to the Google Chrome
- Refresh pages (Azure DevOps and Timecockpit)

## How to use it
- Hover over the task in the Azure DevOps
- Cick on the first button on the right side (this button sends a message with the task name, rrequirement name and task ID to internal memory of the extension)
     - Note: the second button just copies the task name to the clipboard
- Go to the Timecockpit, open the add entry dialog and click on the extension button (above the bookmarks bar) to fill in data.
